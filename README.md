This is a program written in c that is designed to detect if a given email is spam or not based on the email contents as well as comparing with a predefined whitelist and blacklist.
This program utilises hash maps and a bloom filter to efficiently check whether an email is considered spam or not.
The user can use their own whitelist and blacklist text files.
